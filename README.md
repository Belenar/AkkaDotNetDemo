# Akka.NET Code samples
This repository contains the code samples for my 'Processing IoT data with Akka.NET' workshop.

Next to the starter solution, and the slides, you will also see a few branches of completed workshops.

## Getting ready
Since there are quite a few moving parts to this demo/workshop, it's best to run through the following steps in order to have a working state to start our coding from:

1. **Visual Studio 2017**  
If you don't already have Visual Studio 2017, you can use the 'Visual Studio Community Edition'. This version will be sufficient to run this demo. You can download it for free [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). 
2. **.NET Framework 4.7.2**  
We will be running this demo on the full .NET Framework, version 4.7.2. You can find the SDK installer for .NET Framework 4.7.2 [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/net472-developer-pack).
3. **.NET Core 2.1**  
Our demo uses ASP.NET Core 2.1. In order to have the web server component available for debugging, you should install .NET Core 2.1. You can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.1.503-windows-x64-installer).
4. **Get the code**  
If you are faimiliar with GIT, you can simply clone this repository. If not, you can simply download it as a .zip archive, using the button at the top of this page:
